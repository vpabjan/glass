- Compatible with compositors such as **picom** (recommended)

## Philosophy

Glass aims to be stable, efficient, simple, performant, and highly configurable.

It is explicitly viewport-focused. As a result, window minimization is not supported and will not be added by design. Likewise, window decorations are intentionally omitted. A user skilled enough to use Glass is expected to distinguish their windows and remember the small, essential set of keybindings.

Glass favors clarity, explicit control, and minimal abstraction over convenience features.
